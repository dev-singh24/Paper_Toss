## Problem Statement
Proximity and Mobile Controlled Waste Bucket for Home Automation
## Solution
Creating a waste bucket using an Arduino Uno along with Ultrasonic Sensor, HC-05 Bluetooth Module and a Servo Motor(SG90).The ultrasonic sensor measures the distance from the object standing infront of the waste bucket and depending upon the distance, the servo motor moves the lid of the bin. The lid can also be controlled by Mobile Phone using Bluetooth if one wishes to play Paper Toss while relaxing on his bed. The code is uploaded in this repository.
